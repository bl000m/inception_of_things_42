# Server Node (mpaganiS): 
# This is the machine where the K3s server is running. 
# It hosts the control plane components, including etcd, 
# API server, controller manager, and scheduler. 
# The server node is responsible for managing the overall 
# state of the cluster.

# Worker Node (mpaganiSW): 
# This is a machine that runs workloads (containers) 
# as instructed by the control plane. 
# Worker nodes don't have the full control plane 
# components but play a role in executing and managing 
# the applications.

# Control Machine (or Management Machine): 
# This is the machine where you have kubectl installed. 
# with network connectivity to the K3s cluster. 
# The control machine is responsible for interacting 
# with the Kubernetes API server on the server node.
